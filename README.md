Build an accessible form

### Accessibility Checklist for Forms: 

- [ ] all inputs in a form are associated with a corresponding label - use a clear visual label, not placeholder text
- [ ] Match the label’s for="" attribute with the input’s id="" attribute. OR wrap the input in the label
- [ ] use fieldset to break up longer forms and legend to make it clear what each section of the form is for 
- [ ] inputs autocomplete where appropriate
- [ ] use focus styling - You need strong visual cues on your forms so that keyboard navigators know which fields are being selected
- [ ] Provide special instructions to screen readers via aria-labels if necessary 
- [ ] Errors are displayed in a list above the form after submission (this happens during form validation - we won't be covering this topic today)
- [ ] Associate input error messaging with input it corresponds to (this happens during form validation - we won't be covering this topic today)
- [ ] Make sure error, warning and success are inidcated by more than just colour (this happens during form validation - we won't be covering this topic today)
- [ ] Using most semantic element possible
- [ ] all attributes are filled in and filled in correctly
- [ ] title attribute is used where necessary
